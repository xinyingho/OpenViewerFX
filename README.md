# OpenViewerFX

OpenViewerFX was the open-source version of JPedal by IDR Solutions (LGPL 3).

The last version of OpenViewerFX that could properly process PNG/TIFF images within PDF seems to be v6.6.14. The advanced imaging manipulation sub-library has been since migrated to JDeli SDK. It looks like IDR doesn't maintain nor provide any versions of OpenViewerFX anymore.

This repository holds the custom version of OpenViewerFX used by Negatron. It's v6.6.30 with some minor modifications to re-integrate PNG/TIFF image decoding as of v6.2b05.
