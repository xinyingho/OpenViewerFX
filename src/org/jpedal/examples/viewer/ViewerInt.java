/** PDF viewer
 *
 * If you are compiling, you will need to download all the examples source files from http://www.idrsolutions.com/how-to-view-pdf-files-in-java/
 *
 * Run directly from jar with java -cp jpedal.jar org/jpedal/examples/viewer/Viewer
 * or java -jar jpedal.jar
 *
 * Lots of tutorials on how to configure on our website
 * 
 * There is also a JavaFX Viewer documented at
 * http://files.idrsolutions.com/samplecode/org/jpedal/examples/viewer/OpenViewerFX.java.html
 *
 * If you want to implement your own
 * Very simple example at http://files.idrsolutions.com/samplecode/org/jpedal/examples/jpaneldemo/JPanelDemo.java.html
 * But we would recommend you look at the full viewer as it is totally configurable and does everything for you.
 *
 * See also http://javadoc.idrsolutions.com/org/jpedal/constants/JPedalSettings.html for settings to customise
 *
 * Fully featured GUI viewer and demonstration of JPedal's capabilities
 *
 * <br>This class provides the framework for the Viewer and calls other classes which provide the following
 * functions:-
 *
 * <br>Values commonValues - repository for general settings
 * Printer currentPrinter - All printing functions and access methods to see if printing active
 * PdfDecoder decode_pdf - PDF library and panel
 * ThumbnailPanel thumbnails - provides a thumbnail pane down the left side of page - thumbnails can be clicked on to goto page
 * PropertiesFile properties - saved values stored between sessions
 * SwingGUI currentGUI - all Swing GUI functions
 * SearchWindow searchFrame (not GPL) - search Window to search pages and goto references on any page
 * Commands currentCommands - parses and executes all options
 * SwingMouseHandler mouseHandler - handles all mouse and related activity
